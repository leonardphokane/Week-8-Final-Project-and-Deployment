# Week-8-Final-Project-and-Deployment

This assignment requires you to design, code, and deploy a multipage website. The project will demonstrate your skills in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and website deployment.
You will:
•	Design a website with at least three pages (e.g., Home, About, Contact) and ensure it’s responsive.
•	Use HTML5 for semantic structure, CSS3 for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity (e.g., form validation, image sliders).
•	Deploy the website using a platform like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
•	Submit all website files (HTML, CSS, JS, images) along with a live website URL and project documentation.
